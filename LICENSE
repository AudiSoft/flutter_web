AudiSoft software component single developer license agreement
--------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for choosing AudiSoft software components!

AudiSoft software component license agreement between  AudiSoft  Consulting  SAS
(AudiSoft) and holder of the software component license.

This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which you  may  use
the AudiSoft  software  component.  You  should  review  the  entire  agreement,
including any supplemental license terms that accompany  the  software  and  any
linked terms, because all of the terms are important and  together  create  this
agreement that applies to you. You can review linked terms by pasting  the  link
into a browser window.

By accepting this agreement or using the software component, you agree to all of
these terms, and consent to  the  transmission  of  certain  information  during
activation and during your use of the software  as  per  the  privacy  statement
described below. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you  may  not
use the software component or its features.

This agreement applies to the AudiSoft  software  component  that  you  acquired
directly or from a retailer, the media on which you received  the  software  (if
any), any fonts, icons, images or sound files included with  the  software,  and
also any AudiSoft updates, upgrades, supplements or services for  the  software,
unless other terms come with them.

The software component may include third-party programs that are licensed to you
under this agreement, or under their own terms.

The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you  you  the
right to:

- install and run one instance of the software component  on  your  device  (the
  licensed device), for use by one person at a time, so long as you comply  with
  all the terms of  this  agreement.  Updating  or  upgrading  from  non-genuine
  software does not make your software version genuine, and in  that  situation,
  you do not have a license to use the software.
- use the software component for development of  applications  or  any  type  of
  software module in general by a single person within the  company  holding the
  license.
- sell any commercial compiled application with the AudiSoft software component,
  published by the company holding the license.
- make modifications to the source code of software component for own use.
- use the software component and source code on all development systems used  by
  the developer assigned by the company holding the license.
- request future versions of the software component at any time  either  through
  the web or by email for a full version cycle of the software component.  After
  expiry of the registration AudiSoft can no longer provide any old  version  of
  software, documentation or samples.
- make a single copy of the software for backup  purposes.  AudiSoft  is  not  a
  backup  service  and expects backups to be made by the licensed user.
- access to priority email support by  the  single  developer  assigned  by  the
  company holding the license during the registration period.
- sell any number  of  applications  in  any  quantity  without  any  additional
  run-time fees required.

The license agreement prevents you from:

- distributing parts  or  full  source  code  of  any  software  component  from
  AudiSoft.
- using parts or full source code  of  software  components  from  AudiSoft  for
  creating any type of other software components that are  distributed  or  sold
  with or without source code.
- changing the source code of any software component from AudiSoft and  sell  or
  distribute this as a modified product.
- creating a descendant compiled product such as dll, jar, exe, OCX  or  ActiveX
  control and sell or distribute this as a product.
- using the software component in applications  sold  with  different  publisher
  name than the company holding the license.
- transfering the license to another developer.
- transfering the license to another company.
- using the software component by multiple developers in the company holding the
  license.
- publishing, copying (other than the permitted backup copy), renting,  leasing,
  or lending the software.
- using the software as  server  software,  for  commercial  hosting,  make  the
  software available for simultaneous use by  multiple  users  over  a  network,
  install the software on a server and allow users to  access  it  remotely,  or
  install the software on a device for use only by remote users.

You are authorized to use this software only if you are  properly  licensed  and
the software component has been properly activated with a genuine product key or
by other authorized method. When you connect to the  Internet  while  using  the
software, the software will automatically contact AudiSoft or its  affiliate  to
conduct activation to associate it with a certain device. Then  transmission  of
certain information will occur, and Internet, telephone and SMS service  charges
may apply. During activation (or reactivation that may be triggered  by  changes
to your device’s components), the software  may  determine  that  the  installed
instance of  the  software  is  counterfeit,  improperly  licensed  or  includes
unauthorized changes. You may also receive reminders to obtain a proper  license
for the software. Successful activation does not confirm that  the  software  is
genuine or properly licensed. You may not bypass or circumvent activation.

The license agreement terminates immediately after violation of any of the terms
and conditions described.

Your privacy is important to us. Some of the software component features send or
receive information when using those features. Many of  these  features  can  be
switched off in the user interface, or you  can  choose  not  to  use  them.  By
accepting this agreement and using the software  you  agree  that  AudiSoft  may
collect, use, and disclose the information.
